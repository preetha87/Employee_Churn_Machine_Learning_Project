# Employee_Churn_Machine_Learning_Project
This repository comprises of all the Machine Learning-related Python codes for building predictive models (utilizing Ensemble methods such as Random Forest, Adaptive Boosting and Gradient Boosting) to pinpoint those significant factors that cause the employees of a company to churn. The best model was chosen after extensive parameter tuning for each Ensemble method. Additionally, k-fold cross validation was applied and the data set was balanced through the application of SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique). This project was undertaken as part of the coursework for the Data Mining module at Dublin Business School.
